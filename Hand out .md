# Hand out 



## In this course I studied : - 


- **Statistic //  Sql  // Tableau**




## The projects :


- Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself.


- Understand how the Udacity review system works. The project review system is one of the absolute best aspects of being a Udacity student, and it is the key to becoming a Nanodegree graduate. You must pass all the projects!


- Glimpse into your future. By the end of this program, you will not only be able to draw conclusions from these dashboards, but you will be able to build dashboards for yourself just like the ones you see here in the first project!
