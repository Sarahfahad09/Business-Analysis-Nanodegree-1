## SQL database.

When you are working with large amounts of data in multiple spreadsheets, this is an indication that it might be time to move your data to a SQL database. **SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language,** and it is fast at performing many of the tasks of Excel. However, SQL can work across more than one spreadsheet at a time. Most companies rely heavily on databases to store and organize their data. Being comfortable writing SQL queries to access and analyze data from a database is an essential skill for analysts. According to an analytics manager at Apple, when it comes to technical skills, "SQL skills trump all."




## The projects :


- Begin building your data intuition by looking at data dashboards and drawing insights for yourself.


- Understand how the Udacity review system works. The project review system is one of the absolute best aspects of being a Udacity student, and it is the key to becoming a Nanodegree graduate. You must pass all the projects!


- Glimpse into your future. By the end of this program, you will not only be able to draw conclusions from these dashboards, but you will be able to build dashboards for yourself just like the ones you see here in the first project!
